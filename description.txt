This mod utilises a completely randomized formula to create a completely chaotic AI set for every NPC. 
This mod also has configs to change your experience, as well as some configuration to machine performance, such as setting a value to stop AI Scrambling when your machine runs at “X” FPS or lower, as well as disabling the Scrambler for aiStyles that crash the game when scrambled.
You can turn slimes into sentient loot boxes, make Queen Bee break-dance, have Skeletron and Skeletron Prime constantly shed their arms, make biome mimics participate in choir, have Betsy fly without wings, and so much more.
Expect six things when you use this mod: 

1) Complete Chaos
2) A LOT of sound effects
3) Severe NPC spasms
4) A lot of implosion 
5) Nigh-impossible bosses
6) Hyper-active slimes

Unfortunately, this mod does not affect certain aiStyles, such as Figher or Bat AI, however it does have some cross-mod compatibility, though not intended. 
If you’re wondering why some bosses from other mods don’t have their AI scrambled, it’s most likely due to them using different code.
Have fun, and good luck.
